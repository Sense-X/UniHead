Hooks
=====

Hooks are used to monitor the training process including time, log, visualization, and so on. Details can be found in 'hooks.py'.

Common hooks
------------

All classes of hook inherit from the 'Hook' class. UP supports the following classes.

* train_val_logger
* auto_checkpoint
* grad_clipper
* auto_save_best
* reload

TrainValLogger
--------------

'TrainValLogger' is used to output the training log which prints losses, time consuming, time remaining, and so on.
UP keeps the traing log which contains tensorboard in training. The log contains losses, accuracy, and so on.

  .. code-block:: yaml
    
    hooks:
      - type: train_val_logger
        kwargs:
          freq: 2           # print log frequency
          skip_first_k: 5   # ignore 5 epochs time consume
          logdir: log       # tennsorboard log path
          summary_writer: tensorboard # choices = [tensorboard, pavi] # when use pavi, can not check log with tensorboard

AutoSaveBest
------------

Keeping the checkpoint with highest accuracy.

  .. code-block:: yaml
    
    trainer:
      max_epoch: 19              # total epoch nums
      test_freq: 19              # (best ckpt) validate interval
      test_start: 1              # (best ckpt) validate start epoch
      save_freq: 1               # ckpt save interval
      save_start: 1              # ckpt save start epoch
      save_cur_start: -1         # default -1ï¼Œif the num> 0 means ckpt the epoch start to real-time save 
      save_cur_freq: 2           # ckpt real-time save interval(epochs)

    hooks:
      - type: auto_save_best

AutoCheckpoint
--------------

The checkpoint will be automatically saved when training is stopped.

  .. code-block:: yaml
    
    hooks:
      - type: auto_checkpoint

Gradient Clip
-------------

Gradient clipping supports the following three modes.

    * Predefined norm
    * Averaged norm
    * Moving averaged norm

  .. code-block:: yaml
    
    hooks:
      - type: grad_clipper
        kwargs:
          mode: pre_defined  # specific norm
          norm_type: 2
          max_norm: 10

    or

    hooks:
      - type: grad_clipper
        kwargs:
          mode: average    # average
          norm_type: 2
          tolerance: 2.0   # if over average, 2 times clip

    or

    hooks:
      - type: grad_clipper
        kwargs:
          mode: moving_average  # sliding average
          momentum: 0.9
          norm_type: 2
          tolerance: 5.0        # if over average, 2 times clip
