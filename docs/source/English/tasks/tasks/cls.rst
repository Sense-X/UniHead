High precision baseline
-----------------------

UP supports two kinds of settings of high precision baseline of resnet including bag of tricks and resnet strikes.

Bag of tricks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

UP imports the precision improvement way from `Bag of Tricks for Convolutional Neural Networks <https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.01187>`_ to resnet18 and resnet50. Specifically, 200 epochs, 5 epoch warmup, coslr learning rate decay, and mixup data augmentation. The mixup way is mentioned as above and the 'coslr' learning rate decay is shown as followed.
  
  .. code-block:: yaml

    lr_scheduler:
      warmup_iter: 3130
      warmup_type: linear
      warmup_register_type: no_scale_lr
      warmup_ratio: 0.25
      type: CosineAnnealingLR
      kwargs:
          T_max: 200
          eta_min: 0.0
          warmup_iter: 3130

Resnet strikes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

UP imports the precision improvement way from `ResNet strikes back: An improved training procedure in timm <https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.00476>`_ to resnet18 and resnet50. Specifically, Random Augment increasing, 'cutmix', 'mixup', 'LAMB' optimization, 'coslr' learning rate decay, and BCE classification loss function. UP supports training configs of 100 epochs and 300 epochs. The using of 'LAMB' is as followed.

         kwargs:
           {}


The using of Rand Augument Increasing is as followed (the augmentation can be enhanced by increasing n, m, and std.)


  .. code-block:: yaml
    
    random_augmentation: &random_augmentation
      type: torch_random_augmentationIncre
